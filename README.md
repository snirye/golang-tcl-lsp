# golang-tcl-lsp
TCL language server writen in go

# why?
I happend to use TCL in my job, and its not fun.
I hope this will make it a bit more fun.

# Features:
- [ ] syntax error detection
- [ ] autocompletion for function name
- [ ] autocompletion for variable name
- [ ] ...

those are the first things came up to my mind while riding the train,
were going to add more stuff in

# how:
## AST
we start with creating an AST for tcl, and use it for all the features.
not yet sure how to do it, but i started to learn about BNF and it seems like it could work
